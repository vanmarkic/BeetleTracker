### Team : [Lionel Bidegaray](https://github.com/Lyioh), [Marco Tampieri](https://github.com/MarcoTampieri),[François Héliodore](https://github.com/louis878), [Dragan Markovic](https://github.com/vanmarkic),

This exercise was about client communication and planning. We had to learn to use new design tools, plan our work to save development time (though there wasn't any coding in this project), and communicate user stories through UML diagrams.

## Learning Objectives
- Define the client’s needs
- Scope the project
- Define User functionalities (login, logout, delete, ...)
- Prepare a UML diagram (for both navigations and actions)
- Prepare a wireframe of the website with for example balsamiq
- Prepare a mockup of the website using a design tool such as Figma
- Communicate the endresult with the client
- Add a quality readme

### [Exercise README FILE](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Swartz-2.6/blob/master/Assessment/UML.md)



## Content

1. A UML file showing the flow of the design.
2. A wireframe of the proposed design
3. Mockup files of the styled wireframes along with png images of said mockups.





## Challenges
* Provide a useful tool that can also change mindset.
* Raise awareness about renewable energy in general
* Raise awareness about optimal moment for plugging in relation with amount of renewable energy present on the network.
* Help flatten peaks and downs related to the unpredictability of renewable energy production by suggesting best plugging time to the enduser.

## Further improvements
* link rnwbl nrg production data with company consumption data.
* auto detect charging for smartphone with our app installed on it, reward in case of green behavior.
