# BeetleTracker 3 Days Sprint
### BECODE.ORG - 2018

### Team : [Lionel Bidegaray](https://github.com/Lyioh), [Marco Tampieri](https://github.com/MarcoTampieri),[François Héliodore](https://github.com/louis878), [Dragan Markovic](https://github.com/vanmarkic),

This exercise was about client communication and planning. We had to learn to use new design tools, plan our work to save development time (though there wasn't any coding in this project), and communicate user stories through UML diagrams.

## Learning Objectives
- Define the client’s needs
- Scope the project
- Define User functionalities (login, logout, delete, ...)
- Prepare a UML diagram (for both navigations and actions)
- Prepare a wireframe of the website with for example balsamiq
- Prepare a mockup of the website using a design tool such as Figma
- Communicate the endresult with the client
- Add a quality readme
